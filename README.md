# cropImage
It takes file path and crop the image into desired aspect ratio then makes copies in the same folder of image. Eg. if you have an image of 12000x900 and you set ratio='16X9' then you will get 7 images of 1600x900 and one 800x900. 

It creates childrens of original image, in given aspect ratio.

I find this useful when i have to show a long image, eg. on website portfolio section.
